**Design patterns**Â are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code
## Creational
These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
- [[CleanCode/Factory]]
- [[CleanCode/Abstract Factory]]
- [[CleanCode/Builder]]
- [[CleanCode/Prototype]]
- [[CleanCode/Singleton]]
## Structural
These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
- [[CleanCode/Adapter]]
- [[CleanCode/Bridge]]
- [[CleanCode/Composite]]
- [[CleanCode/Decorator]]
- [[CleanCode/Facade]]
- [[CleanCode/Flyweight]]
- [[CleanCode/Proxy]]
## Behavioral
These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
- [[CleanCode/Chain of Responsibility]]
- [[CleanCode/Command]]
- [[CleanCode/Iterator]]
- [[CleanCode/Mediator]]
- [[CleanCode/Memento]]
- [[CleanCode/Observer]]
- [[CleanCode/State]]
- [[CleanCode/Strategy]]
- [[CleanCode/Template Method]]
- [[CleanCode/Visitor]]
